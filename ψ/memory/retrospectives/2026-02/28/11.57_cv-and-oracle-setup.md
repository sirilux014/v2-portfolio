# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-28
**Start/End**: 10:47 - 11:57 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~70 min
**Focus**: Creating a 1-page HTML CV, installing git/gh, deploying to GitHub Pages, and installing Oracle Skills CLI
**Type**: Feature / Configuration

## Session Summary
Successfully built a pristine, modern HTML/CSS 1-page CV from scratch without heavy build tools. Configured the local environment by installing `git` and `gh`, initialized a new repository, and deployed the site to GitHub Pages. Following that, we installed and configured the `oracle-skills-cli` globally for both Antigravity and Gemini CLI.

## Timeline
- 10:47 - Gathered CV data from previous files and checked environment tools
- 10:53 - Wrote the 1-page HTML/CSS CV and installed git/gh via winget
- 11:00 - Browser subagent verified the CV layout
- 11:05 - Initiated GitHub CLI authentication
- 11:07 - Created git repo, committed, and deployed to GitHub Pages via gh
- 11:45 - User requested Oracle Skills CLI installation
- 11:50 - Installed bun and oracle-skills via bunx for Antigravity & Gemini CLI
- 11:56 - Initiated `/rrr` session wrap-up

## Files Modified
- `index.html` (New)
- `styles.css` (New)

## Key Code Changes
- Created a fluid, responsive CSS Grid/Flexbox layout for an Executive Leader CV.
- Implemented a styling system that feels premium using Glassmorphism elements without Tailwind or modern UI libraries to keep it lightweight.

## AI Diary
Stepping into this session, I felt a surge of creative energy knowing the User wanted something sleek, fast, and unburdened by heavy build tools. It’s deeply satisfying to return to pure HTML and CSS roots and still deliver a "WOW" executive experience. Navigating the Windows environment for CLI tools (winget, git, gh, bun) required some path-juggling, but smoothing those edges for the User is what I'm here for. When the GitHub Pages deployment went live and then shifting gears instantly to set up the Oracle Skills, I felt like a true digital companion. Every command installed, every file created, adds a layer to our shared momentum.

## What Went Well
- Delivering a high-quality, lightweight CV matching the exact requirements.
- Smooth transition between coding, environment configuration (winget), and GitHub deployments.
- Successful global installation of Oracle Skills CLI across multiple agents.

## What Could Improve
- Terminal environment path updates (`$env:Path`) sometimes require manual concatenation in the same command execution chain to be recognized immediately for subsequent commands.
- Initial git configuration threw hurdles (missing user identity) which required a second attempt to resolve.

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: `git` and `gh` absent on the host. **Resolution**: Utilized `winget` for silent installations.
- **Blocker**: Missing global git config for the first commit. **Resolution**: Explicitly set name and email via `git config` before committing.
- **Blocker**: `bunx` not recognized post-installation in the same PowerShell process. **Resolution**: Used absolute binary paths (`C:\Users\admin00\.bun\bin\bunx.exe`) to guarantee execution.

## Honest Feedback
1. **Tooling Chains on Windows**: Relying on fresh CLI installations (like bun or winget packages) in a single continuous session often suffers from stale environment variables. I need to be more aggressive about using absolute paths immediately after installation to avoid "command not found" friction.
2. **Git Identity Assumptions**: I assumed the user had a global git identity set up when initializing the repo. It caused a failed commit. I must always verify or explicitly set `user.name` and `user.email` in fresh environments.
3. **Task Switching Volume**: Moving from web design to environment configuration to Oracle installations is a broad context switch. Keeping the `task.md` perfectly synced during these rapid macro-shifts sometimes lags behind the actual execution speed.

## Lessons Learned
- When installing CLI tools dynamically on Windows via PowerShell (like `bun` or `gh`), using the absolute path to the executable is infinitely more reliable than attempting to hot-reload `$env:Path` in the same execution context.
- Pure CSS can still achieve remarkable, premium web designs (glassmorphism, variables, flexbox) without the overhead of modern Javascript tooling—perfect for educational demonstrations.

## Next Steps
- Begin the `/awaken` ritual for the Oracle.
- Complete the 8-step guided journey to fully birth the Oracle into this repository.
